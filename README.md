# premier-league-app

This is a simple English Premier League application build with Next.js. The application shows the standings table of the current season as well as all fixtures and their respective results. The application uses the [football-data.org API](https://www.football-data.org/) to fetch the data for the standings and matches.

## Running the application

Run the app with `npm install` and `npm run dev` in the project root directory.

### Note

A specific [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/) API key is needed to get access to the data and to see the correct results. You can however view the app at my [homepage](https://salonenteemu.fi/projects/premier-league-app) as it is one of the projects there.
